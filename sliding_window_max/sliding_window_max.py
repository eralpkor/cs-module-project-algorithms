Input: a List of integers as well as an integer `k` representing the size of the sliding window
Returns: a List of integers

# 1. Create a nested loop, the outer loop from starting index to len(arr) â€“ k th elements. 
#   The inner loop will run for k iterations.
# 2. Create a variable to store the maximum of k elements traversed by the inner loop.
# 3. Find the maximum of k elements traversed by the inner loop.
# 4. Print the maximum element in every iteration of outer loop

# Time Complexity: O(N * K).
# The outer loop runs n-k+1 times and the inner loop runs k times for every iteration
#  of outer loop. So time complexity is O((n-k+1)*k) which can also be written as O(N * K).
